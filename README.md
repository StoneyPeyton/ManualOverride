# ManualOverride
Manual Override Full use, no snubbed out content, resources, and all that other dark shit big leagues use.


First off, I use LinkedHelper chrome extension. If you'd like to steal it simply wipe your chromes browser cache and etc once the 2 week trial runs out.

Personally, its about the CSV files so if you'd like to save them, gotta buy the app.
*I haven't found an exploit yet.*

There are many tools, guides and methods.
The manual override is derived from my own data, and purpose of how to rally a network of activity for many purposes.

1. Install Linkedhelper, *watch the videos its quite simple to use*

2. Send out a broadcast to your scraped 1st contacts, do this by making a list and customizing a message, *be sure to use {firstname} command to trick most people that its not copy and paste.*
*Activity is king, and it dwindles everywhere.*

2.1 *Make sure your message engages the audience you must swap messages back and forth to show up on their feed*
2.2 *Profile views also helps you show up on their feed, so make them curious really sell yourself*


3. All those whom respond, are active. Tag them on your post, and encourage comments over likes.

4. Use Linkedhelper to bot target search parameters, mine are entertainment industry, greater atlanta area, and artist. This works, and weeds out wasted invites. (3,000) send out limit, its best to target people to send invites to you.

5. Those who accepted those invites are active too, tag them once you've broken the ice with them, otherwise you'll look like a spam bot, not a savy tool user. *tag them in the comments*

6. Depending on your purpose, mine personally is to expose artist to producers, rally artists of all sorts. Then sprout up a magazine competition to gather traffic activity, which is used to bounce a post up. Whilst building a talent agency / entertainment studio of sorts overtime.

*side note, never resend a message to avoid people reporting you for spam*

*This is the manualoverride, it harnesses the backend of linkedins Aritifial Intelligence, by using smart bots, and tools.*
*7. Step to come, I'll be running this for clients in the future, then pulling all of it together to start another one of my viral spirals.
